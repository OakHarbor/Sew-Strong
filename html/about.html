                Sewstrong volunteers have

                of people who need them ASAP.</strong> We came together to address the current crisis in the healthcare 
                industry and community settings surrounding protection from COVID-19 infection.

                We fill requests

                Our medical advisory team provides input on our cloth face mask design. They base their input on 
                current scientific and industrial recommendations. Our current standard is a pocket design cloth 
                mask with elastic ear loops or ties. This is the design recommended by the CDC for use when no 
                commercially made masks are available. We value feedback from our customers and our volunteers on 
                how to improve. We strive to make the highest quality products and deliver in a timely manner.

                <p>Susan recently retired from Virginia Mason Institute, where she coached 
                   executives in healthcare organizations, to lead large scale change focused on patient and 
                   staff safety and quality care delivery.  Prior to joining the institute, Susan worked as an 
                   executive lean consultant with John Black and Associates (JBA), supporting the lean 
                   transformation in Saskatchewan healthcare. She served as a strategic guide and coach for 
                   executive teams, trained leaders, set up client lean offices, coached improvement events, 
                   and led sustainable, measurable implementations. She was the lead consultant for three 
                   provincial level agencies including the Ministry of Health. Susan joined JBA after a 30-year 
                   career at Boeing, which immersed her in a lean journey that began in the 1980s and spanned 
                   strategy development, training, process management, and new product development in the services 
                   division. Susan is trained in the Virginia Mason Production System®.

                <p>Working with underserved populations and developing health care programs that meet their needs has been 
                   the focus of my 50-year career as a primary care pediatrician and educator. By working in Liberia 
                   (West Africa), I learned a great deal about epidemic control and consequences during the Ebola virus epidemic 
                   in 2014. I see the current coronavirus epidemic as a learning experience for us in rich countries to 
                   know how to mobilize community support and to create and share low cost reusable items that can be shared 
                   world-wise to help slow the rapid spread of this and future global epidemics.

                <p>Our independent community pediatric practice has been creating constantly evolving workflows 
                    in order to serve our patient population during this pandemic. We try to keep our patients, 
                    families, staff and doctors as safe as possible and to use available protective equipment to 
                    prevent the spread of COVID19 in our clinic. We quickly began to run low on manufactured Personal 
                    Protective Equipment and when our supply for disposable gowns became critical, we switched to 
                    rain ponchos and reversed engineered how to make more gowns out of plastic sheeting.   We will 
                    continue to evaluate and innovate to keep all of us safer.

                <p>My interest in this was sparked not only because of the situation at my work in an Intensive 
                   Care Unit, but because of my experience in humanitarian and remote healthcare. I started researching 
                   reusable masks and I didn't find very much information, so I started looking at options that could be 
                   effective, durable and reusable for use in a variety of environments.  I know that the impact of this 
                   virus will be far worse in communities that have no running water, no electricity, no way to isolate 
                   or distance themselves and no definitive healthcare for miles.
